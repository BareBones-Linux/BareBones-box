## BetterBox
A modified version of busybox that has an end goal of being more efficent than busybox in most use-cases.

## What's being worked on?
- Coreutils in a different, more efficent language.
- Adding more complex necessities such as Python and nano over vi.
- Overall becoming a nicer, minimal user-space compared to busybox.
